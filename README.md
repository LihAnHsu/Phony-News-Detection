# Phony-News-Detection
Data source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification

The goal of this project is using ML model on purely text content to detect our target (phony news or real news?)

Finding:

1) Phony news often refers to politics-related terms in word clouds.

2) Real news often refers to more general topics without specific terms being used too frequently in word clouds.

3) The accuracy of prediction by Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVC) is nearly 95.8%.
